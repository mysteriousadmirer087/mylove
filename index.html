            Some people enter your life like a quiet melody—soft, unassuming, yet unforgettable. That’s what you are to me. A presence so effortlessly enchanting that even time seems to slow when you’re around.<br/>
            
            And those curls of yours… My God. They aren’t just hair; they are poetry in motion, framing your face with perfect chaos. If the breeze lingers around you a little longer, I understand—it, too, must have fallen for you, just like I did.<br/>
            
            If love had a language, it would speak through stolen glances and unspoken words. No matter how crowded the room, my eyes find you first. I may just be a shadow in your world, but you—you are my whole sky.<br/>
            
            You looked ethereal—like you weren’t just walking through life but dancing through it, like you weren’t just existing but glowing. It’s unfair how effortlessly you steal hearts without even trying. And mine? It’s been yours for longer than you’ll ever know.<br/>
            
            Until that day, just know—somewhere nearby, there’s someone whose world starts and ends with you.<br/>
            
            Yours,<br/>
            The One Who Loves You in Silence<br/>
